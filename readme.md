# CONSOLE APPLICATION : CopyHierarchy
## Description
This is a very simple tool to copy a hierarchy of folders (discarding files).

For Windows only.

## Disclaimer
So far this app has been quickly created to help a friend dealing with a repetitive task. It's not elegant and it's not been well tested and no safeguards are implemented. Use this at your own risks.
Furhtermore no effort has been done to ease cross compilation on other systems.

## Usage
- Put the executable in the folder containing the root of the hierarchy you want to copy.
- Execute the program and give it the name of the root folder whose hierarchy you want to copy.
- Wait until the end, the copied hierarchy will appear in a new folder named "hierarchy".

Remark: it is not mandatory to move the executable in the right folder, but you will need to give an absolute path to the root folder (or a correct relative one)
    Warning: do not try to copy a folder containing the executable, it may never end...
